# Can I pay contributors with my own funding on Utopian?

Yes, you can reward contributors with your own funding apart from the upvoting system. You can buy STEEM or SBD and then send it to the contributor's Steem account as payment. Utopian has no restrictions on how project owners can reward their contributors. You can even put up bounties in STEEM or SBD.
