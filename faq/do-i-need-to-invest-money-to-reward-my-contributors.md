# Do I need to invest money to reward my contributors?

Currently, Utopian rewards contributions made on the platform that are reviewed by moderators. Although you do not need to invest into the rewards by yourself, it is highly recommended to find sponsors for your project who can increase the potential rewards of the contributors. It is your responsibility to find sponsors either internally (those already on Utopian) or by finding sponsors who will purchase Steem Power and delegate it to your project directly. There will be default rewards, however.

Even if you were not able to find a sponsor for your project, all contributions can be rewarded through Utopian voting system, which votes for reviewed contributions. However, these cannot be guaranteed to be high and may not be enough to support your project to the fullest.
