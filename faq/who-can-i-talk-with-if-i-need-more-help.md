# Who can I talk with if I need more help?

You can post a message in the **#help** channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/EMpRhmq) and one of Utopian's moderators will get in touch. If you need direct assistance from Community Managers and/or Utopian core staff you can send a ticket on our [Help Desk](https://support.utopian.io).
