# What is Utopian & STEEM?

Utopian is the only platform that rewards contributors of Open Source projects by utilizing a decentralized, vote-based reward system.

We support open source enthusiast, DIY makers and developers of open source projects with our unique rewarding system. To pay the rewards, Utopian.io uses the STEEM blockchain. The money is created in the form of a cryptocurrency called STEEM, through community voting. Nobody has to pay for the rewards directly. They are generated and distributed using an algorithm called Proof-of-Brain, which encourages people to create and curate quality content.
