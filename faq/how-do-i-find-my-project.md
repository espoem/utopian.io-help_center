# How do I find my project?

Projects that have not had any contributions via Utopian cannot be seen on the platform currently. If your project has had contributions, then you can find it by searching for its name in the search box. In the new version of Utopian, project owners will be able to add their projects to Utopian via a different method which includes a lot more metadata. This feature will be available when Utopian gets out of beta.

[Read the Project Owner Quick Start Guide](../guides/quickstart_project-owners.md) to learn more about getting your projects on Utopian
