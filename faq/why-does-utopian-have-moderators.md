# Why does Utopian have moderators?

In order to ensure a conducive and productive environment for Open Source collaboration, Utopian uses the concept of human moderation to help align the interests of both project owners and contributors. By having manual reviews performed by people who are knowledgeable about a project's vision, Utopian gives chance to high quality contributions that move projects forward.

There are two kinds of moderators active on the Utopian platform: **Project Moderators** and **Utopian Moderators**.

## Project Moderators

These are moderators who review contributions made to specific Open Source projects only.


## Utopian Moderators

These moderators review contributions made to the Utopian.io project itself, and contributions for projects that have no assigned moderators, and they also offer assistance to Utopian users.
