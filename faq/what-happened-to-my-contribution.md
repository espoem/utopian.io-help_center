# What happened to my contribution?

If you have made a contribution, it will be put under review (if you used the correct tags) and will be reviewed by Utopian moderators in the next 72 hours.

To check this procedure, you can head to [Utopian Rocks](https://utopian.rocks) and see if you can find your contribution in the list called "Waiting for Review" if your contribution is in this list, that means the contribution hasn't been reviewed by a Utopian moderator yet and is pending review.

If you can't find your contribution on the review list you can head over to [Utopian Rocks Queue](https://utopian.rocks/queue) to see the list of reviewed contributions. These contributions are reviewed by Utopian moderators and may be up for a potential reward.

Please don't forget that all upvotes by Utopian happens after the contributions has passed 24 hours mark.
