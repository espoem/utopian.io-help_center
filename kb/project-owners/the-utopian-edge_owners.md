Project owners who join Utopian gain access to a global talent pool and a new way to reward their contributors. The Utopian platform enables project owners to bring more attention to their project and coordinate project development.

# A global talent pool

Utopian is home to many open source contributors from all over the world. As a project owner on Utopian, you can make **task requests** for your projects and quickly crowdsource from an international talent pool. Get the attention of valuable contributors and use the power of collective intelligence to develop your projects.

# More visibility

Projects with an active presence on Utopian are more visible to Open Source contributors out there. Utopian's social tools also allow contributors to browse and discover projects they might want to contribute to.

# Incentivized contributions

Project owners can use Utopian to incentivize development in particular areas of their Open Source project. By offering guaranteed cryptocurrency rewards and/or bounties, they can enlist contributors quickly and easily.

# Find reputable and skilled people to work with

Every contribution made to Open Source projects and submitted to Utopian is stored in the immutable blockchain called Steem. This serves as a verifiable and trustworthy record of work and experience that project owners can use to assess contributors and their proficiency levels. Individual contributor profiles will show what they have worked on before and how well it was received.
