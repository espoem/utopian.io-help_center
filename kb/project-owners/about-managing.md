# About managing your Open Source projects on Utopian

Project owners can use Utopian to rapidly increase contributions and to give their projects more visibility in the vast Open Source world.

Utopian is still in beta, and at present, to have your project show up on Utopian and get the attention of contributors, you'll need to create task requests for your project. In the near future, a more streamlined process will be available that will allow project owners to create entries for their projects in the Utopian database, including all the metadata associated with it. A promotion system is also in the pipeline, and it will allow project owners to promote their projects to potential sponsors and contributors. These features, coupled with task requests, will give project owners powerful tools to communicate with and enlist contributors.

To start the process of getting your projects on Utopian, follow the guidelines in the [Project Owners Quick Start Guide](guides/quickstart_project-owners.md).

Task requests can be made to acquire contributions in the following categories:

- Thinkers
- Developers
- Bug Hunters
- Translators
- Designers
- Tech Writers
- Data Analysts
- Influencers

*More categories may be added. If you have a category that you would like to see featured then feel free to [contact the Utopian moderators on Discord](https://discord.gg/UCvqCsx).*
