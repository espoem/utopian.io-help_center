# Managing your Steem wallet

Many reminders are made during the account creation process, but this point cannot be stressed enough: **your password/owner key is the only way to exercise ownership over your account and you should never lose it or expose it to unwarranted persons.** Therefore, *password* or *cryptographic key* protection is the most important aspect of managing a Steem wallet.

A Steem account has a hierarchical key structure, with four different types of private keys that give particular account permissions:

- **Owner Key:** this is the master key for your account, with ***all permissions***, and it has the power to change all the other keys
- **Active Key:** this is used to to place market orders and to make currency transfers, and it also gives posting permissions
- **Posting Key:** this is used for posting and voting on posts only
- **Memo Key:** this is used to create and read memos only

## Keeping your private keys safe

- Do not store your cryptographic keys in plain text where untrusted people can access them
- If you choose to store your keys on the cloud, consider encrypting the text files first before uploading them
- Be careful not to paste your private keys in your posts by mistake as this will expose them to the whole world
- Have sufficient backups of your private keys (both online and offline)
- Whenever you feel that your keys have been compromised, quickly change your Steem master password, as this will also change all keys associated with your account.
