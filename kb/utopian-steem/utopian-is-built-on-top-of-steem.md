# Utopian is built on top of Steem

One of the most important things that set Utopian apart from other platforms that seek to
monetize Open Source work is that it is built on a unique, special-purpose
blockchain called Steem. Steem can be likened to a public database that stores
people's intellectual property and creates an economic system from it. People
get paid to create and curate content within the Steem ecosystem.

Utopian is an app that uses the Steem blockchain to store user's entries for contributions to
various Open Source projects and it also utilizes Steem's built-in economic
model to reward Open Source contributors who share their work on Utopian. It
also supports more direct reward channels such as STEEM and SBD transfers where
project owners can reward contributors by directly sending them STEEM or SBD
(which are the Steem blockchain's native currencies).

The Steem blockchain enables Utopian to offer other enhanced social features that make Open Source
contribution a socially engaging experience. The vision is that Utopian will be
a place where people collectively come together and work on Open Source projects
for the betterment of the entire Open Source movement, and get economic value
from it. Most of these features are still in development and they will be
available as Utopian gets out of beta.
